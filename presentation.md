# Outline

1. What is Testing?

2. What is Continuous Integration

3. Let's look at an example.

---

# What is the purpose of testing?

- Verify our tool doesn't crash

--

- Make sure inputs/outputs are in the expected form

--

- Make sure our tool handles corner-cases

--

- Make sure the outputs are of sufficient "quality"

--

- Evaluate performance

--

- Identify bugs

--

- Test the effectiveness of bug fixes

--

- ...

# Example of unit test from giga connectome 0.6.0

Let's look at the original function in `giga_connectome/mask.py`

--

```python
def _check_mask_affine(
    mask_imgs: Sequence[Path | str | Nifti1Image],
) -> list[int] | None:
    """Given a list of input mask images, show the most common affine matrix
    and subjects with different values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mask_imgs : :obj:`list` of Niimg-like objects
        See :ref:`extracting_data`.
        3D or 4D EPI image with same affine.

    Returns
    -------

    list or None
        Index of masks with odd affine matrix. Return None when all masks have
        the same affine matrix.
    """
    ...
```

# Example of unit test from giga connectome 0.6.0

What do you expect this test to do?

Test in: `giga_connectome/tests/test_mask.py`:

--

```python
def test_check_mask_affine():
    """Check odd affine detection."""

    img_base = np.zeros([5, 5, 6])
    processed_vol = img_base.copy()
    processed_vol[2:4, 2:4, 2:4] += 1
    processed = Nifti1Image(processed_vol, np.eye(4))
    weird = Nifti1Image(processed_vol, np.eye(4) * np.array([1, 1, 1.5, 1]).T)
    weird2 = Nifti1Image(processed_vol, np.eye(4) * np.array([1, 1, 1.6, 1]).T)
    exclude = mask._check_mask_affine(
        [processed, processed, processed, processed, weird, weird, weird2]
    )
    assert len(exclude) == 3
    assert exclude == [4, 5, 6]
```

# How do we store our tests?

- Module and functions
- External scripts
- Example workflows
- Executable documentation
- Evaluate performance (speed, memory)

## If we are supposed to do this every time we change something...

# Continuous integration

![:img Continuous Integration, 60%](assets/ci.jpg)

---
template: footer

# We want to

- Write the basic scaffolding of our project

--

- Set it up to install and run using CI

--

  - if we went so far as to write the tests first, this would be called "test driven development"

--

- Add tests alongside new features

--

- Let CI spend time running the tests while we go drink coffee

---

# Tools used in the hands on

## Pytest for writing and running tests
## Github actions for the continuous integration
