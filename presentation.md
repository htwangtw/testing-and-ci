# Outline

1. What is testing?

2. What is Continuous Integration

3. Let's practice both.

---

# What is the purpose of testing?

- Verify our tool doesn't crash

--

- Make sure inputs/outputs are in the expected form

--

- Make sure our tool handles corner-cases

--

- Make sure the outputs are of sufficient "quality"

--

- Evaluate performance

--

- Identify bugs

--

- Test the effectiveness of bug fixes

--

- ...

# How do we store our tests?

- Module and functions
- External scripts
- Example workflows
- Executable documentation
- Evaluate performance (speed, memory)

## Should we test our tests ?

## If we are supposed to do this every time we change something...
## ... when would we have time to do anything else ðŸ˜±?!

# Continuous integration

![:img Continuous Integration, 60%](assets/ci.png)

---

template: footer

# We want to

- Write the basic scaffolding of our project

--

- Set it up to install and run using CI

--

  - if we went so far as to write the tests first, this would be called "test driven development"

--

- Add tests alongside new features

--

- Let CI spend time running the tests while we go drink coffee

---

# Tools used in the hands on

## Pytest for writing and running tests
## Github actions for the continuous integration
