# Testing in Python with Pytest


.footnote[
    Pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/
]

.pull-left[

First you need to install `pytest`:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

A minimal example:

```python
# content of test_sample.py
def inc(x):
    return x + 1


def test_answer():
    assert inc(3) == 5

```

Run it:

```bash
pytest test_sample.py
```
]

In a package (Bonus)

- Usually, we store our test in a directory called `tests`
    
- The test files will be named after the module name, prefix with `test_`, such as `tests/test_mymodule.py`

- Then you can configure `pyproject.toml` to specify where the tests are:

    ```toml
    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    testpaths = ["tests/"]
    ```
- You can then run `pytest` at the root of the package to trigger the tests.
- Otherwise you have to specify the path:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_mymodule.py
    ```

# Example of test from giga connectome 0.6.0

Let's look at the original function in `giga_connectome/mask.py`
.footnote2[
    https://github.com/bids-apps/giga_connectome/blob/main/giga_connectome/mask.py
]
--

```python
def _check_mask_affine(
    mask_imgs: Sequence[Path | str | Nifti1Image],
) -> list[int] | None:
    """Given a list of input mask images, show the most common affine matrix
    and subjects with different values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mask_imgs : :obj:`list` of Niimg-like objects
        See :ref:`extracting_data`.
        3D or 4D EPI image with same affine.

    Returns
    -------

    list or None
        Index of masks with odd affine matrix. Return None when all masks have
        the same affine matrix.
    """
```

# Example of test from giga connectome 0.6.0

Test in: `giga_connectome/tests/test_mask.py`:

.footnote2[https://github.com/bids-apps/giga_connectome/blob/main/giga_connectome/tests/test_mask.py]

--

```python
def test_check_mask_affine():
    """Check odd affine detection."""

    img_base = np.zeros([5, 5, 6])
    processed_vol = img_base.copy()
    processed_vol[2:4, 2:4, 2:4] += 1
    processed = Nifti1Image(processed_vol, np.eye(4))
    weird = Nifti1Image(processed_vol, np.eye(4) * np.array([1, 1, 1.5, 1]).T)
    weird2 = Nifti1Image(processed_vol, np.eye(4) * np.array([1, 1, 1.6, 1]).T)
    exclude = mask._check_mask_affine(
        [processed, processed, processed, processed, weird, weird, weird2]
    )
    assert len(exclude) == 3
    assert exclude == [4, 5, 6]
```

--

You can run this very specific test like this:
```bash
pytest giga_connectome/tests/test_mask.py::test_check_mask_affine
```

# Principles of testing

- Test locally first

- Test frequently

- Write small tests

- Use test to examine the complexity of the function
